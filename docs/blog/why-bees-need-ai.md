# Why Bees Need AI (And Why AI Needs Bees)

When I tell people I'm building AI-powered beehives, I usually get one of two reactions: "That's so cool!" or "...why?"

The second question is actually the more interesting one.

## The Problem

Beekeepers lose 30-50% of their colonies every year. That's not a typo. Imagine if farmers lost half their cattle annually—we'd call it a crisis. For bees, it's just... Tuesday.

The causes are complex: varroa mites, pesticides, climate change, habitat loss. But here's the thing—most colony deaths are preventable *if you catch the warning signs early enough*. The problem is that those signs are subtle: a 2°C temperature shift, a change in hum frequency, a slight weight fluctuation.

Humans can't monitor this 24/7. But sensors can. And AI can find patterns humans miss.

## What We Built

BuzzHive combines temperature, humidity, weight, and acoustic sensors with ML models trained on healthy vs. struggling colonies. When something's off, beekeepers get an alert on their phone.

Simple concept. Surprisingly hard execution.

## What I Learned

1. **Real-world ML is humbling.** Our models work great in the lab. Then a bee decides to build comb directly on a sensor.

2. **Domain expertise matters more than model architecture.** The best insights came from beekeepers with 30 years of experience, not from hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Edge cases are the whole game.** The difference between "colony is preparing to swarm" and "colony is dying" can look identical to an algorithm.

## The Bigger Picture

Working on BuzzHive has shaped how I think about AI more broadly. We talk a lot about LLMs and chatbots, but some of the most impactful AI applications might be in domains we rarely discuss—agriculture, ecology, conservation.

Bees pollinate 80% of flowering plants and one-third of our food supply. If AI can help keep them alive, that matters.

And honestly? Debugging a neural network while wearing a bee suit is a uniquely grounding experience.
