# From Physics to AI: Why I Switched (Sort Of)

"Wait, you did Engineering Physics? How did you end up in AI?"

I get this question a lot. Here's the honest answer: I didn't really switch. I just followed the problems.

## The Physics Mindset

Physics trains you to think in terms of systems, constraints, and emergent behavior. You learn that complex phenomena often arise from simple rules applied at scale. You get comfortable with uncertainty and approximation.

Sound familiar?

## The Connection

Modern AI—especially deep learning—is basically applied statistical physics with better marketing. Concepts like:
- Energy landscapes and optimization
- Phase transitions in learning dynamics  
- Information theory and entropy
- Emergent behavior from simple components

These aren't metaphors. They're direct mathematical connections.

## Why AI, Why Now

I switched focus because AI felt like where the most interesting *unsolved* physics-style problems live right now. Questions like:
- Why do overparameterized models generalize?
- What's the geometry of representation spaces?
- How do capabilities emerge from scale?

These are physics questions wearing a computer science costume.

## The Math Background Helps

My double major in Mathematical Sciences wasn't planned—I just kept taking math classes because they were useful for physics. Turns out, that background is exactly what you need for ML theory.

Measure theory for probability. Functional analysis for optimization. Topology for understanding representation spaces. It all connects.

## Advice for Physics Students Curious About AI

1. **Don't abandon your intuitions.** The physics way of thinking—dimensional analysis, symmetry arguments, limiting cases—works in ML too.

2. **Learn the engineering side.** Physics trains you to derive. ML requires you to also implement. Get comfortable with PyTorch.

3. **Find problems that excite you.** AI is huge. The physics-to-AI pipeline is crowded with people doing theory. Consider applications where physical intuition matters—robotics, scientific ML, sensor systems.

## Looking Back

I don't regret the "detour" through physics. If anything, it gave me a different perspective than people who went straight into CS. Sometimes being an outsider is an advantage.
